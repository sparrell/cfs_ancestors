== Other
notes: Charity Schufeldt is presumably a descendant of Johann George Zufelt and his wife, Anna Catherine Zaam who emigrated with their children to New york about 1710. They came in a group of Evangelical Protestants fleeing religious persecution in the German pricipality of Pfalz (now the State of Rhineland- Palatinate or Rhine-Pfalz).They founded the town of Rhinebeck on the Hudson River.
