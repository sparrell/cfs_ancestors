Robert Allyn  1616-1683 <p></p> <p>..From Jacobus 1948 & Arnold 1965:</p> <p>According to testimony he gave in court in 1680 (Duff and Jacobus 1945 note</p> <p>that this was in a case of Edward Smith v Estate of John Smith), Robert was</p> <p>born in England about 1616.</p> <p></p> <p>He came to Gloucester Ma with the Dorchester Co. in 1624.  In 1636 he settled</p> <p>at Salem Ma with his brother William in the section of town which became</p> <p>Manchester.  Robert was a landowner in 1637, a freeman in 1649, a member of the church in May 1642 and Constable in 1648.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1651 Robert moved to Pequot (New London Ct), receiving a home lot onCape</p> <p>Ann Lane.  In 1653 he received a Pocketannock Grant, northeast of New London,</p> <p>resulting in a large farm on the east side of the Thames, at a place still known</p> <p>as Allyn's Point (now in the town of Ledyard about 1 mile north of Gales Ferry).</p> <p>He moved there in 1656 and built a wharf and trading house on what later (1667)</p> <p>became part of the Mashantucket Indian reservation.</p> <p></p> <p>In June 1659 Robert left his farm and became one of the original proprietors of</p> <p>Norwich Ct, receiving a home lot of 5 acres in November of that year. He was</p> <p>dismissed to Norwich by the First Church of Salem Ma on 12 Jan 1662/3. He was made Constable in 1669.  He later returned to Allyn's Point, giving his Norwich lot to his son John, and later exchanging it for land nearer Allyn's Point. <p></p> <p>He left his widow Sarah 1/3 of his real estate and 100 pounds of personal</p> <p>estate.  Thomas Rose came to own the farm where Robert had lived, through the</p> <p>distribution to his heirs and in deeds of 1685 and 1688.  Each daughterwas</p> <p>given L66 6s.  Carpenter's tools are mentioned in the inventory of his estate.</p> <p>(Settlement of estate in New London Land Records 5-87 and New London County</p> <p>Court Records 4-56.)</p> <p></p>
