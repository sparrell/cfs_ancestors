notes: Robert Allyn  1616-1683 ..From Jacobus 1948 & Arnold 1965: According to testimony he gave in court in 1680 (Duff and Jacobus 1945 note that this was in a case of Edward Smith v Estate of John Smith), Robert was born in England about 1616. He came to Gloucester Ma with the Dorchester Co. in 1624.  In 1636 he settled at Salem Ma with his brother William in the section of town which became Manchester.  Robert was a landowner in 1637, a freeman in 1649, a member of the church in May 1642 and Constable in 1648. In 1651 Robert moved to Pequot (New London Ct), receiving a home lot on Cape Ann Lane.  In 1653 he received a Pocketannock Grant, northeast of New London, resulting in a large farm on the east side of the Thames, at a place still known as Allyn's Point (now in the town of Ledyard about 1 mile north of Gales Ferry). He moved there in 1656 and built a wharf and trading house on what later (1667) became part of the Mashantucket Indian reservation. In June 1659 Robert left his farm and became one of the original proprietors of Norwich, Ct, receiving a home lot of 5 acres in November of that year. He was dismissed to Norwich by the First Church of Salem Ma on 12 Jan 1662/3. He was made Constable in 1669.  He later returned to Allyn's Point, giving his Norwich lot to his son John, and later exchanging it for land nearer Allyn's Point. He left his widow Sarah 1/3 of his real estate and 100 pounds of personal estate.  Thomas Rose came to own the farm where Robert had lived, through the distribution to his heirs and in deeds of 1685 and 1688.  Each daughter was given L66 6s.  Carpenter's tools are mentioned in the inventory of his estate. (Settlement of estate in New London Land Records 5-87 and New London County Court Records 4-56.)
occupation: Carpenter and farmer
