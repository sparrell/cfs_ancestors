He was for a brief time at Weymouth, Mass but soon removed to Wethersfield, Conn where he owned land as early a 1641.  He enlisted from Wethersfield for service in the Pequot War of 1637.  He sayed in Wethersfield and Hartford for a few years but in 1649 was in New London, Conn where he took up a house lot the next year.  His home in New London was on Post Hill near the north corner of Williams and Vauxhall Streets and he apparently died there about 1663 at an advanced age.  Late in life on Feb25 1661/62 the following appears about him.
