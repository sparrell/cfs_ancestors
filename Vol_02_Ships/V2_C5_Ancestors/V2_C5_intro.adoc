= Volume 2 Chapter 5 - Ancestors
This chapter contains the details of all 
915 unique ancestors.

Because of some ancestors having multiple lineages,
(many with 2 but some with as many as 9)
this represents 
1635 ancestors with
720 duplicates.

https://github.com/sparrell/cfs_ancestors/tree/main/Vol_02_Ships/V2_C2_Ships[Chapter 2] 
has the ships 59 of the ancestors came in on.

https://github.com/sparrell/cfs_ancestors/tree/main/Vol_02_Ships/V2_C3_No_Ships[Chapter 3] 
has 320 additional ancestors who were immigrants but we do not know the ship.

https://github.com/sparrell/cfs_ancestors/tree/main/Vol_02_Ships/V2_C4_Brick_Walls[Chapter 4] 
has 124 brickwalls.

All 503 of those people are included in this chapter,
along with the 412 ancestors between the prinipals and the line terminations.

There are 323 surnames across the ancestors. 
The surnames can be found in the indices.
