notes: "The earliest settler to this country, bearing the family name of whom we have record, and the ancestor of what has long been known as the BRIDGEWATER BRANCH of the Leonard family must have been born about 1610 in Monmouthshire or vicinity; in the southwesterly part of England. <p>He seems to have emigrated first to Leyden in Holland probably with his father  whose name is believed to be Samuel. There is some probabilitythey came together--if so the father must have died soon after. The exact period that Solomon emigrated to this country and the place from which he embarked  has been impossible to asertain. (between 1629 and 1633 most probably)
occupation: Weaver
