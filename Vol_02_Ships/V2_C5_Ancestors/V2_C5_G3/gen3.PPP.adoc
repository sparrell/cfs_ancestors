notes: <p>&nbsp;</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>When Herbert K. Sparrell returned to Worcester from the Civil War in 1864, he was still in his teens. He went to work for a local butcher/sausage maker and learned the

2 CONC ring to the local German immigrant community. In 1872 Herbert married Louisa Katherine, one of the identical twin daughters of Franz. In August 1873, Franz died leaving Herbert and Louisa to run the s
2 CONC hop. Louisa and Herbert extended credit to their customers, entering the sums due in a large ledger. In 1874 a financial panic occurred. Many customers lost their jobs and were unable to pay their bil

2 CONC Americans.  (Inthose days, beer and ale were locally brewed and distributed in barrels to saloons. If you wanted beer, you drank ina saloon or took a tin container called a "growler" down to the saloo
